# Today-Schedule

My Task


Creating a simple calendar application that allows the user to save and schedule events every hour on the hour.


User Story


AS AN employee with a busy schedule

I WANT to add important events to a daily planner

SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

WHEN I open the planner

THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours

WHEN I view the time blocks for that day

WHEN I click into a time block

THEN I can enter an event

WHEN I click the save button for that time block

THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

WHEN I refresh the page

THEN the event remains saved


Mock-Up
